# hangmanSolver
This solver works by calcuating the expected number of remaining possible words for each possible guess (a-z) and choosing the character with the lowest expected value. This solver is currently configured for english, but the algorithm can be used for any language. It is also to be noted that this solver does not follow the safest hangman strategy, and will take riskier options if they have higher informational value. This is generally not to be concerned as it converges towards the correct solution very rapidly, and so the number of incorrect guesses in my tests have always been of a manageable amount. Details of execution can be found in script.py.
